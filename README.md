# Welcome to the world of React

# Food App

Here we build our app, first we made a raw sketch about the app overall structure. There after using functional component we build each layer i.e. header, body, footer. In body we used props and mapping of array. We used real data from Swiggy official site for learning purpose that how real data works.

# React Hoooks

Normal JS functions - written by Meta developers written in React package. There are multiple hooks:-

-useState() - superpowerful state variables. Used to change UI based on code without any delay.
-useEffect() - Called after rendering is done. Very interesting.
Both should be created only inside component and at the top so that code don't get error in future.
